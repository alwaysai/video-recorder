# Simple Video Recorder

This app will start recording a video when it is started and save the video when the app is shut down, either by the stop button on the Streamer or exiting with CTRL-C. The video feed will also be displayed on the Streamer.

The FPS is set to 30, but may need to be updated if the camera being used has a different FPS. Ideally, the recording FPS should match the camera FPS for videos to look natural.
